### Overview

<hr>

Now-a-days portfolio websites are pretty common. These websites are like CVs which includes all the informations regarding a person. So following this trend, I have also made a portfolio website for myself.

### About

<hr>

So portfolio websites generally contain all the informations that one provides in a CV. But CVs being purely professional, only contains information about a person that are required professionally. But here is no such limitation in Portfolio websites. One can add any kind of information about oneself that he/she wants the world to know. Also having a good portfolio website is a must in today's technical world. This often solves the tedious process of searching for a way to contact people. Anyone can find all the necessary contact information one needs about one person from these portfolio websites.

### Tech Stack

<hr>

Here I have used only HTML and CSS. 

But we can also make this using any frontend development frameworks like React.

### Conclusion

<hr>

I have made this project using HTML and CSS only. But I'll continue to make this project into a solid and fully fledged one as I learn more tech stacks in the field of Web Dev.
